# Tailwind CSS Styles Not Applying After DOM Manipulation

This repository demonstrates an uncommon bug in Tailwind CSS where styles fail to apply after certain DOM manipulations, specifically using JavaScript to dynamically insert or update elements.  The issue is not related to basic Tailwind usage, but arises in scenarios involving dynamic content updates and Tailwind's re-rendering mechanism.

## Bug Description
Styles defined in Tailwind classes sometimes fail to apply when elements are added or modified to the DOM via JavaScript. This can lead to inconsistent styling or elements appearing without the expected styling. This is more than likely due to a misunderstanding of Tailwind CSS and how it integrates with dynamic JavaScript updates.

## Solution
Ensure that Tailwind CSS is properly re-rendering after DOM manipulation to apply new styles.  Consider using the `@apply` directive judiciously when applying classes within your JavaScript rather than creating separate class names.
