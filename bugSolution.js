```javascript
//solution using a function to re-render the tailwind styles
function reRenderTailwindStyles() {
  //Force a re-render of Tailwind CSS.  The specific method depends on your setup.
  //This may involve triggering a re-render event on your application
  //or using a library like AlpineJS to manage state changes and re-rendering.
}

//some javascript code that uses tailwindcss classes and calls reRenderTailwindStyles after every DOM manipulation
